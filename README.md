# RootMorphology
## RSA2_source_code
The MATLAB source code as modified by piqueen314. To run this code an installation of MATLAB with Bioinformatics Toolbox and Image Processing Toolbox add ons installed.
Open the folder in MATLAB double click file RSA_GUI.m to show it in editor window. Click the green play button labeld "Run" to use the RSA application.
## RootSystemImages
Contains raw data images of morning glory seedlings before processing to black and white in GIMP.
Also contains Input images of morning glory root systems used in the project. The input images may be directly input in to RSA MATLAB appliction to quantify the root systems. Image width in (cm) may be obtained from .csv data files.
## *.csv files
Data files contains output of root system measurement as determined by MATLAB RSA code
## RootMorphology.ipynb
R code for statistical analysis and ggplot strip charts
